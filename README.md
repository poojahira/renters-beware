This is a web analytics application created in Apache Spark and HTML for renters to access relevant but hard-to-acquire information on the neighborhoods and buildings that they are interested in renting in. The application provides users with a heat map view of New York City dwellings and neighborhoods based on statistics derived from our datasets. It also provides a query form for the user to lookup a specific buildingâ€™s data regarding the crimes committed around it, housing violations, 311 service requests, a neighborhood score, a safety score, an investment/gentrification score and a quality of life score for the address provided. It is hoped that, upon using the application, a potential renter has an extensive picture of the housing option under consideration before making the final decision to rent.
